# Accessing the lab environment

[Go back to the Table of Contents](./README.md)

For the labs related to the IBM Edge Application Manager, you will be using the central Hub server installed in IBM Cloud. This environment is setup to be multi-tenant where each student has their own userid.  Each student will have their own managed edge device in Skytap that you will manage from the centralized Hub server.

## Connecting to the IBM Edge Application Manager UI

To access the Hub cluster open a browser on your workstation and point it to:

[Edge Hub Console](https://fs20edgem.169.62.229.212.nip.io:8443)

**ATTENTION: Lab tutorials were tested with Firefox browser.**

## Connecting to the managed devices

[SKYTAP - Access your Managed devices](https://ibm.biz/fs20skytap)
[SKYTAP - Access your Managed Cluster](Source: https://ibm.biz/fs20skytap)

To access the managed devices you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty

Open the Session URL given you by instructor. You should see the form similar to the one shown below:

<span style="color:red">**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SKYTAP UI TO CONNECT TO THE MACHINE - YOU WILL USE A TERMINAL CONNECTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WORKSTATION**</span>

You should see the page that looks like this

Take a note of address and the port number, next to the **edge-device** VM. In above example, it is *services-uscentral.skytap.com* and *12316*. It is the SSH port exposed from the virtal machine for your instance.

Open the terminal on your workstation. Connect to the VM using user **localuser** with password **passw0rd**

For Mac and Linux
```
ssh -p <port> localuser@<address>
```

for example:
```
ssh -p 12316 localuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com
```

For Windows use putty

## Copying files between your local workstation and edge-device

When you need to copy any file between your local workstation and VMs in Skytap, use the following:

For Mac and  Linux
```
scp -P <port> <source-file> localuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com:<target-path>
```

For Windows use WinSCP or equivalent tool
